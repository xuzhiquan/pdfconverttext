Prepare Data for Modeling
[ 70 ]
Even from these relatively few numbers we can tell quite a bit:
•
All of the features are positively skewed. The maximum values are a number
of times larger than the average.
•
The coefficient of variation (the ratio of mean to standard deviation) is very
high (close or greater than 1), suggesting a wide spread of observations.
Here's how you check the skeweness (we will do it for the 'balance' feature only):
fraud_df.agg({'balance': 'skewness'}).show()
The preceding code produces the following output:
A list of aggregation functions (the names are fairly self-explanatory) includes:
avg(), count(), countDistinct(), first(), kurtosis(), max(), mean(), min(),
skewness(), stddev(), stddev_pop(), stddev_samp(), sum(), sumDistinct(),
var_pop(), var_samp() and variance().
Correlations
Another highly useful measure of mutual relationships between features is
correlation. Your model would normally include only those features that are highly
correlated with your target. However, it is almost equally important to check the
correlation between the features; including features that are highly correlated among
them (that is, are collinear) may lead to unpredictable behavior of your model, or
might unnecessarily complicate it.
I talk more about multicollinearity in my other book, Practical Data
Analysis Cookbook, Packt Publishing (https://www.packtpub.com/
big-data-and-business-intelligence/practical-data-
analysis-cookbook), in Chapter 5, Introducing MLlib, under the section
titled Identifying and tackling multicollinearity.
