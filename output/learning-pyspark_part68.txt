First, we will encode the schema as a string, per the [schema] variable below. Then
we will define the schema using StructType and StructField:
# Specify schema
schema = StructType([
StructField("id", LongType(), True),
StructField("name", StringType(), True),
StructField("age", LongType(), True),
StructField("eyeColor", StringType(), True)
])
Note, the StructField class is broken down in terms of:
•
name: The name of this field
•
dataType: The data type of this field
•
nullable: Indicates whether values of this field can be null
Finally, we will apply the schema (schema) we created to the stringCSVRDD RDD
(that is, the generated.csv data) and create a temporary view so we can query it
using SQL:
# Apply the schema to the RDD and Create DataFrame
swimmers = spark.createDataFrame(stringCSVRDD, schema)
# Creates a temporary view using the DataFrame
swimmers.createOrReplaceTempView("swimmers")
With this example, we have finer-grain control over the schema and can specify that
id is a long (as opposed to a string in the previous section):
swimmers.printSchema()
This gives the following output:
In many cases, the schema can be inferred (as per the previous section)
and you do not need to specify the schema, as in this preceding example.
