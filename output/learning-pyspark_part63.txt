In the following screenshot, you can see the Spark job' sparallelize operation
is from the first cell generating the RDD stringJSONRDD, while the map and
mapPartitions operations are the operations required to create the DataFrame:

In the following screenshot, you can see the stages for the parallelize operation
are from the first cell generating the RDD stringJSONRDD, while the map and
mapPartitions operations are the operations required to create the DataFrame:
