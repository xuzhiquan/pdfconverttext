Prepare Data for Modeling
[ 64 ]
Note that calling the .toPandas() can be problematic, as the method
works essentially in the same way as .collect() in RDDs. It collects
all the information from the workers and brings it over to the driver. It
is unlikely to be a problem with the preceding dataset, unless you have
thousands upon thousands of features.
The records parameter to the .to_dict(...) method of pandas instructs it to
create the following dictionary:
Since we cannot calculate the average (or any other numeric metric of a categorical
variable), we added the missing category to the dictionary for the gender feature.
Note that, even though the mean of the age column is 40.40, when imputed, the type
of the df_miss_no_income.age column was preserved—it is still an integer.
Outliers
Outliers are those observations that deviate significantly from the distribution of
the rest of your sample. The definitions of significance vary, but in the most general
form, you can accept that there are no outliers if all the values are roughly within
the Q1−1.5IQR and Q3+1.5IQR range, where IQR is the interquartile range; the IQR
is defined as a difference between the upper- and lower-quartiles, that is, the 75th
percentile (the Q3) and 25th percentile (the Q1), respectively.
Let's, again, consider a simple example:
df_outliers = spark.createDataFrame([
(1, 143.5, 5.3, 28),
(2, 154.2, 5.5, 45),
(3, 342.3, 5.1, 99),
(4, 144.5, 5.5, 33),
(5, 133.2, 5.4, 54),
(6, 124.1, 5.1, 21),
(7, 129.2, 5.3, 42),
], ['id', 'weight', 'height', 'age'])
