In our scenario, we are querying the total delays by city and origin code for the state
of Washington. This will require joining the flight performance data with the airports
data by International Air Transport Association (IATA) code. The output of the
query is as follows:
Using notebooks (such as Databricks, iPython, Jupyter, and Apache Zeppelin), you
can more easily execute and visualize your queries. In the following examples, we
will be using the Databricks notebook. Within our Python notebook, we can use the
%sql function to execute SQL statements within that notebook cell:
%sql
-- Query Sum of Flight Delays by City and Origin Code (for Washington
State)
select a.City, f.origin, sum(f.delay) as Delays
from FlightPerformance f
join airports a
on a.IATA = f.origin
where a.State = 'WA'
group by a.City, f.origin
order by sum(f.delay) desc
