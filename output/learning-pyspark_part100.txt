Chapter 4

The preceding code will produce the following chart:
As you can see, there are plenty of fraudulent transactions that had 0 balance but
many transactionsâ€”that is, a fresh card and big spike of transactions. However, no

Summary
In this chapter, we looked at how to clean and prepare your dataset for modeling
by identifying and tackling datasets with missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
We also looked at how to get a bit more familiar with your data using tools from
PySpark (although this is by no means a full manual on how to analyze your
datasets). Finally, we showed you how to chart your data.
We will use these (and more) techniques in the next two chapters, where we will be
building machine learning models.
