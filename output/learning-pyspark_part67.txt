DataFrames
[ 44 ]
The **kwargs construct allows you to pass a variable number of
parameters to a method at runtime.
Going back to the code, after initially creating the swimmersJSON DataFrame,
without specifying the schema, you will notice the schema definition by using
the printSchema() method:
# Print the schema
swimmersJSON.printSchema()
This gives the following output:
But what if we want to specify the schema because, in this example, we know that
the id is actually a long instead of a string?
Programmatically specifying the schema
In this case, let's programmatically specify the schema by bringing in Spark SQL data
types (pyspark.sql.types) and generate some .csv data for this example:
# Import types
from pyspark.sql.types import *
# Generate comma delimited data
stringCSVRDD = sc.parallelize([
(123, 'Katie', 19, 'brown'),
(234, 'Michael', 22, 'green'),
(345, 'Simone', 23, 'blue')
])
