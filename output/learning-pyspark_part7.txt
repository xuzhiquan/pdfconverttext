I would like to thank my family: Rachel, Skye, and Albert—you are
the love of my life and I cherish every day I spend with you! Thank
you for always standing by me and for encouraging me to push my
career goals further and further. Also, to my family and my in-laws
for putting up with me (in general).
There are many more people that have influenced me over the
years that I would have to write another book to thank them all.
You know who you are and I want to thank you from the
bottom of my heart!
However, I would not have gotten through my PhD if it was not for
Czesia Wieruszewska; Czesiu - dziękuję za Twoją pomoc bez której
nie rozpocząłbym mojej podróży po Antypodach. Along with Krzys
Krzysztoszek, you guys have always believed in me! Thank you!
