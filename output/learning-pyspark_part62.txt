Now that we have created the RDD, we will convert this into a DataFrame by using
the SparkSession read.json method (that is, spark.read.json(...)). We will also
create a temporary table by using the .createOrReplaceTempView method.
In Spark 1.x, this method was.registerTempTable, which is being
deprecated as part of Spark 2.x.
Creating a DataFrame
Here is the code to create a DataFrame:
swimmersJSON = spark.read.json(stringJSONRDD)
Creating a temporary table
Here is the code for creating a temporary table:
swimmersJSON.createOrReplaceTempView("swimmersJSON")
As noted in the previous chapters, many RDD operations are transformations, which
are not executed until an action operation is executed. For example, in the preceding
code snippet, the sc.parallelize is a transformation that is executed when
converting from an RDD to a DataFrame by using spark.read.json. Notice that, in
the screenshot of this code snippet notebook (near the bottom left), the Spark job is
not executed until the second cell containing the spark.read.json operation.
These are screenshots from Databricks Community Edition, but all the
code samples and Spark UI screenshots can be executed/viewed in any
flavor of Apache Spark 2.x.
