Prepare Data for Modeling
[ 66 ]
The preceding code produces the following output:
We have two outliers in the weight feature and two in the age feature. By now
you should know how to extract these, but here is a snippet that lists the values
significantly differing from the rest of the distribution:
df_outliers = df_outliers.join(outliers, on='id')
df_outliers.filter('weight_o').select('id', 'weight').show()
df_outliers.filter('age_o').select('id', 'age').show()
The preceding code will give you the following output:
Equipped with the methods described in this section, you can quickly clean up even
the biggest of datasets.
Getting familiar with your data
Although we would strongly discourage such behavior, you can build a model
without knowing your data; it will most likely take you longer, and the quality
of the resulting model might be less than optimal, but it is doable.
