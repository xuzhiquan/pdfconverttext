Project Tungsten
Tungsten is the codename for an umbrella project of Apache Spark's execution
engine. The project focuses on improving the Spark algorithms so they use memory
and CPU more efficiently, pushing the performance of modern hardware closer to
its limits.
The efforts of this project focus, among others, on:
•
Managing memory explicitly so the overhead of JVM's object model and
garbage collection are eliminated
•
Designing algorithms and data structures that exploit the memory hierarchy
•
Generating code in runtime so the applications can exploit modern compliers
and optimize for CPUs
•
Eliminating virtual function dispatches so that multiple CPU calls are
reduced
•
Utilizing low-level programming (for example, loading immediate data to
CPU registers) to speed up the memory access and optimizing Spark's engine
to efficiently compile and execute simple loops
