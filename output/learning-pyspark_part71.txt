Running filter statements using the where
Clauses
To run a filter statement using SQL, you can use the where clause, as noted in the
following code snippet:
# Get the id, age where age = 22 in SQL
spark.sql("select id, age from swimmers where age = 22").show()
The output of this query is to choose only the id and age columns where age = 22:
As with the DataFrame API querying, if we want to get back the name of the
swimmers who have an eye color that begins with the letter b only, we can use
the like syntax as well:
spark.sql(
"select name, eyeColor from swimmers where eyeColor like 'b%'").show()
The output is as follows:
