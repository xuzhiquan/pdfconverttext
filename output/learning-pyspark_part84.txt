Chapter 4
[ 61 ]
Analyzing rows, we see the following:
•
The row with ID 3 has only one useful piece of information—the height
•
The row with ID 6 has only one missing value—the age
Analyzing columns, we can see the following:
•
The income column, since it is a very personal thing to disclose, has most of
its values missing
•
The weight and gender columns have only one missing value each
•
The age column has two missing values
To find the number of missing observations per row, we can use the following snippet:
df_miss.rdd.map(
lambda row: (row['id'], sum([c == None for c in row]))
).collect()
It produces the following output:
It tells us that, for example, the row with ID 3 has four missing observations, as we
observed earlier.
Let's see what values are missing so that when we count missing observations in
columns, we can decide whether to drop the observation altogether or impute some
of the observations:
df_miss.where('id == 3').show()
Here's what we get:
Let's now check what percentage of missing observations are there in each column:
df_miss.agg(*[
(1 - (fn.count(c) / fn.count('*'))).alias(c + '_missing')
for c in df_miss.columns
]).show()
