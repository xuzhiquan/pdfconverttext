Also, no information would be gained from calculating the mean and standard
deviation of the custId column, so we will not be doing that.
For a better understanding of categorical columns, we will count the frequencies of
their values using the .groupby(...) method. In this example, we will count the
frequencies of the gender column:
fraud_df.groupby('gender').count().show()
The preceding code will produce the following output:
As you can see, we are dealing with a fairly imbalanced dataset. What you would
expect to see is an equal distribution for both genders.
It goes beyond the scope of this chapter, but if we were building a
statistical model, you would need to take care of these kinds of biases.

For the truly numerical features, we can use the .describe() method:
numerical = ['balance', 'numTrans', 'numIntlTrans']
desc = fraud_df.describe(numerical)
desc.show()
The .show() method will produce the following output:
