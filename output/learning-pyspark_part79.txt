Checking for duplicates, missing
observations, and outliers
Until you have fully tested the data and proven it worthy of your time, you should
neither trust it nor use it. In this section, we will show you how to deal with
duplicates, missing observations, and outliers.
Duplicates
Duplicates are observations that appear as distinct rows in your dataset, but which,
upon closer inspection, look the same. That is, if you looked at them side by side, all
the features in these two (or more) rows would have exactly the same values.
On the other hand, if your data has some form of an ID to distinguish between
records (or associate them with certain users, for example), then what might initially
appear as a duplicate may not be; sometimes systems fail and produce erroneous
IDs. In such a situation, you need to either check whether the same ID is a real
duplicate, or you need to come up with a new ID system.
Consider the following example:
df = spark.createDataFrame([
(1, 144.5, 5.9, 33, 'M'),
(2, 167.2, 5.4, 45, 'M'),
(3, 124.1, 5.2, 23, 'F'),
(4, 144.5, 5.9, 33, 'M'),
(5, 133.2, 5.7, 54, 'F'),
(3, 124.1, 5.2, 23, 'F'),
(5, 129.2, 5.3, 42, 'M'),
], ['id', 'weight', 'height', 'age', 'gender'])
As you can see, we have several issues here:
•
We have two rows with IDs equal to 3 and they are exactly the same
•
Rows with IDs 1 and 4 are the same — the only thing that's different is their
IDs, so we can safely assume that they are the same person
•
We have two rows with IDs equal to 5, but that seems to be a recording issue,
as they do not seem to be the same person
