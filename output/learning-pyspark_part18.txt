Preface
It is estimated that in 2013 the whole world produced around 4.4 zettabytes of data;
that is, 4.4 billion terabytes! By 2020, we (as the human race) are expected to produce
ten times that. With data getting larger literally by the second, and given the growing
appetite for making sense out of it, in 2004 Google employees Jeffrey Dean and
Sanjay Ghemawat published the seminal paper MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing
on Large Clusters. Since then, technologies leveraging the concept started growing
very quickly with Apache Hadoop initially being the most popular. It ultimately
created a Hadoop ecosystem that included abstraction layers such as Pig, Hive,
and Mahout â€“ all leveraging this simple concept of map and reduce.
However, even though capable of chewing through petabytes of data daily,
MapReduce is a fairly restricted programming framework. Also, most of the tasks
require reading and writing to disk. Seeing these drawbacks, in 2009 Matei Zaharia
started working on Spark as part of his PhD. Spark was first released in 2012.
Even though Spark is based on the same MapReduce concept, its advanced
ways of dealing with data and organizing tasks make it 100x faster than Hadoop
(for in-memory computations).
In this book, we will guide you through the latest incarnation of Apache Spark
using Python. We will show you how to read structured and unstructured data, how
to use some fundamental data types available in PySpark, build machine learning
models, operate on graphs, read streaming data, and deploy your models in the
cloud. Each chapter will tackle different problem, and by the end of the book we
hope you will be knowledgeable enough to solve other problems we did not have
space to cover here.
