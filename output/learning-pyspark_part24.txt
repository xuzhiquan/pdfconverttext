Understanding Spark
Apache Spark is a powerful open source processing engine originally developed by
Matei Zaharia as a part of his PhD thesis while at UC Berkeley. The first version of
Spark was released in 2012. Since then, in 2013, Zaharia co-founded and has become
the CTO at Databricks; he also holds a professor position at Stanford, coming from
MIT. At the same time, the Spark codebase was donated to the Apache Software
Foundation and has become its flagship project.
Apache Spark is fast, easy to use framework, that allows you to solve a wide variety
of complex data problems whether semi-structured, structured, streaming, and/or
machine learning / data sciences. It also has become one of the largest open source
communities in big data with more than 1,000 contributors from 250+ organizations
and with 300,000+ Spark Meetup community members in more than 570+ locations
worldwide.
In this chapter, we will provide a primer to understanding Apache Spark. We
will explain the concepts behind Spark Jobs and APIs, introduce the Spark 2.0
architecture, and explore the features of Spark 2.0.
The topics covered are:
•
What is Apache Spark?
•
Spark Jobs and APIs
•
Review of Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), DataFrames, and Datasets
•
Review of Catalyst Optimizer and Project Tungsten
•
Review of the Spark 2.0 architecture
