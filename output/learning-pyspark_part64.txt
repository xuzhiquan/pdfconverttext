Spark UI of the DAG visualization of the stages within the spark.read.json(stringJSONRDD) job.
It is important to note that parallelize, map, and mapPartitions are all RDD
transformations. Wrapped within the DataFrame operation, spark.read.json (in
this case), are not only the RDD transformations, but also the action which converts
the RDD into a DataFrame. This is an important call out, because even though you
are executing DataFrame operations, to debug your operations you will need to
remember that you will be making sense of RDD operations within the Spark UI.
Note that creating the temporary table is a DataFrame transformation and not
executed until a DataFrame action is executed (for example, in the SQL query to be
executed in the following section).
DataFrame transformations and actions are similar to RDD
transformations and actions in that there is a set of operations that
are lazy (transformations). But, in comparison to RDDs, DataFrames
operations are not as lazy, primarily due to the Catalyst Optimizer. For
more information, please refer to Holden Karau and Rachel Warren's
book High Performance Spark, http://highperformancespark.com/.
