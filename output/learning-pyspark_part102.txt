Introducing MLlib
In the previous chapter, we learned how to prepare the data for modeling. In this
chapter, we will actually use some of that learning to build a classification model
using the MLlib package of PySpark.
MLlib stands for Machine Learning Library. Even though MLlib is now in a
maintenance mode, that is, it is not actively being developed (and will most likely
be deprecated later), it is warranted that we cover at least some of the features of the
library. In addition, MLlib is currently the only library that supports training models
for streaming.
Starting with Spark 2.0, ML is the main machine learning library that
operates on DataFrames instead of RDDs as is the case for MLlib.
The documentation for MLlib can be found here: http://spark.
apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html.
In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:
•
Prepare the data for modeling with MLlib
•
Perform statistical testing
•
Predict survival chances of infants using logistic regression
•
Select the most predictable features and train a random forest model
